im not adding aymore changes..., if I do manage to make a diff version of this using a diff language, im'm just going to put it down as the same thing but with the diff language

it is hard to experiment while trying to keep my old stuff undamaged, so yeah...

This is just a game i made with jquery, html, css and the last remainder of my braincells (just kidding), 
I made it for fun and although it didn't fit the required theme it was fun...
